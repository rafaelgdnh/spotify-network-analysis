Detailed Description: 

Since the mid-2010s, streaming services have revolutionized the music industry, transforming the way music is consumed and distributed. With the rise of platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music, streaming has emerged as the primary source of music consumption within the global recorded music market. This paradigm shift has had profound implications for tie formation and collaboration among music artists. As streaming services continue to dominate the music landscape, artists have recognized the potential for new exposure through collaborations. The ability to seamlessly access music worldwide has incentivized artists to seek out strategic collaborations that not only enhance their artistic expression, but also maximize their visibility and commercial success. Understanding the intricacies of these collaborations sheds light on the social dynamics within the industry while providing valuable insights into the creation and dissemination of music.
